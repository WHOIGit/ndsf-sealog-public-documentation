    "section": "2.5 Event Template Configuration",
    "text": "2.5 Event Template Configuration\nThis section will orient you on how to create Sealog “events.” It is important to note that the primary way of accessing exported data is via a spreadsheet. All “Event Values” and “Event Option” names should be concise.\n\n2.5.1 Adding an Event Template\n\nOnce logged in, navigate to “System Management” then select “Event Management.”\n\nPlease note you need to be logged in as a user, “Guest” does not have event management access. \n\nOn the right hand side, the open for “Create Event Template” will allow you to create a new event.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Button Name\nButton name is the title of the event. In the example below, the button name is “Video Logging” and is used by the SuBastian team to log when the DVR’s begin recording.\n\n\n2.5.3 Event Value\nEvent values are a way of grouping events. For example, if you have several events that count as sampling (ex. coral collection, niskin sampling, biological sampling, etc.,) they can all be grouped as the event value “Sample.” In the dive summary pdf that gets created at the end of every dive, each Event Value will have its own section, summarizing all of the events under the particular Event Value for that dive.\nThe screenshot below shows an example of events that were labeled with the Event Value “Sample” and the different types denote whether they are biological, niskins, or squeezer samples in this dive.\n\n\n2.5.4 Template Categories\nTemplate Categories create different tabs in the home screen to further organize event buttons. In the example below, there are three template categories configured: science, vehicle, video. By default, the “All” category will always show every event button configured.\nSome science parties may want to broaden their own Template Categories beyond the single “Science” that is the default configuration, ex. “Observation, Sample, etc.” The “Vehicle” and “Video” template categories contain important vehicle milestones and should be left unchanged.\n\n\n2.5.5 Free Text Event\nIt is also possible to enter “free text events”. These are events that are logged without using event templates. This could be useful for quick notes, corrections, or if there is not a current event template configured for a certain situation during a dive.\n\n\n2.5.6 Configuring Event Options\nAt the bottom of the “Create Event Template” the “+ Add Option” selection gives you further options to tailor each event.\n    Name\nThe name of the event option describes the specific option you are creating. For example, in the screenshot below, there are two options configured. The first option, named “Action” allows you to choose to either start or stop the dive stream radio buttons. The second option, named “Platform” allows you to choose checkboxes for the platforms that are being started. Event options cannot be named “id” or “comment”- these are reserved keywords.\n    Type\nThe type describes the choice of action you have for this option. The options are described in more detail below. Static Text Static text options are for when the value is known and should not be altered. This can be used when the act of clicking the event button is all that is needed to log the event. In the example below, the event “Vehicle on Deck” will always have a value of “On Deck.”\nText The text option is for when the value possibilities for the option are unknown and must be manually filled out when the event is submitted. This could be used when describing file names, writing the species name of an animal observed during a dive, describing a frame grab, and more.\nDropdown The dropdown option is for when the option is one out of a long list of possibilities. In the example below, a dropdown is used to describe all of the octocoral species to aid in a biological observation event.\nCheckboxes Checkboxes are for when the option is one or more of a list of possibilities. In the example below, this event allows the user to say they’re starting both Facebook and YouTube streams, or just one.\nRadio Buttons Radio buttons are for when the option is one of a short list of possibilities. In the option below, the radio buttons are used to describe an action of starting or stopping the divestream, while checkboxes are used to choose one or all of the listed platforms.\nRequired Button The required button allows you to choose if an entry is necessary before the event can be created. For example, you may want to have any entry that requires a Sample ID or file name as “required” so this can’t accidentally be reported without key information.\nAdditional Text Default with every Event Template, an additional text box will be added that can be used to document any extra information.\n\n\n2.5.7 Saving and Testing Events\nClick “Create” to save your event to the “Event Templates.” Click to edit an Event Template. Click to test an Event Template. This is useful when making new events to make sure all your options are configured how you mean them to be. Click to delete an Event Template. Please ask an MT if you need to delete an event template that was not created by your science party."

Please note that in all events that have the word “sample” in the “Event Value” will be used towards the total number of samples. For sample events, the “Event Value” should ALWAYS be “SAMPLE” and should be configured with the following options:\n\nType\nto specify the type of sample collected i.e. “biology, geology, eDNA, Niskin, etc”. This should be configured as a required option. If the desire is to have a dedicated button for a specific sample type then set this option as “static text” with the “value” set to the sample type i.e. “eDNA”. If the event template is for multiple sample types then the “Type” option should have an option type of “dropdown” or “radio buttons”.\nSample ID\nto define the sample’s unique identification. This generally will be a “text” option. This should also be configured as a required option.\nStorage Location\nthe unique location on the vehicle where the sample is stored. This should be configured as a required option. This option should have an option type of “dropdown” or “radio buttons.” Refer to the list of standard vehicle locations (below) for how to populate the event option values.

    "text": "2.7 Sealog in Use\nOnce event templates are set up for your dive…now it’s time to put the templates in action.\n\n2.7.1 Who Can Use Sealog?\n\nEvery dive, SOI has a datalogger on watch, who works to track information specific to the vessel’s need for operation and outreach and to ensure specific vehicle milestones are set up for Sealog’s reporting mechanisms.\nIt’s up to the science party to provide watchstanders who will log and keep track of scientific data logging needs. Generally at least one (if not all) watchstanders are in charge of adding events as needed during a dive.\nAny scientist onboard the ship who wants to contribute to event logging is able to do so.\n\n\n\n2.7.2 What Do We Log?\n\nCrewmembers will log Vehicle Events that are critical to Sealog operation and reporting mechanisms. We also will log certain highlights for our Outreach team. All of our events will be available to scientists in the data exports and reports.\nWe recommend that Scientists communicate internally about what kinds of events should be logged to best serve your needs. Some examples may be:\n\nWide angle and/or zoom screengrabs of samples prior to sampling.\nScreengrabs to capture sample storage location.\nScreengrabs of biological observations.\nScreengrabs of anthropological observations.\n\n\n\n\n2.7.3 When Do We Log Events?\n\nSealog works best when events are logged during an active dive.\nOften scientists will assign certain individuals to be incharge of logging in Sealog per watch.\nWe can also log Sealog after the fact, but the screen grabs and metadata are NOT captured.\nASNAP is an automatic screengrab that is run at a designated timed interval during the dive. The default settings have ASNAP running once every 60 seconds, that will take a screengrab of video and metadata, so a reasonable log of the dive will exist with minimal science events logged.\n\n\n\n2.7.4 Where Can We Use Sealog?\n\nCurrently, Sealog is only available onboard Falkor (too)’s intranet.\nYou can log events anywhere on the ship that has internet connectivity.\nIn the future we hope to provide access to Sealog for scientists ashore.\n\n\n\n2.7.5 How Should We Use Sealog?\n\nWe provide the resource and it’s up to you as the science party to decide your cruise best practices.\n\nSome examples may include:\n\nTaking a screengrab prior to any sample.\nAdding any important information to be noted with each sample such as ID or storage location.\nLog certain observations during a dive like anthropogenic or biological.\nDuplicating key notes into a spreadsheet or logbook."

    "section": "2.11 Frequently Asked Questions",
    "text": "2.11 Frequently Asked Questions\n\nIs it possible to log an event in the past?\nYes, at the bottom of each event template entry, there is an option for “Custom Time (UTC).” This can be used to adjust the time of the event, however Sealog will not grab past metadata for this entry.\nWhich ROV Depth value is most accurate?\nAccuracy for depth is very much dependent on several factors (sensor calibration, depth, latitude, etc) your best option is to ask the MT’s on your cruise.\nThere are multiple positions in the metadata, which ones should I use?”\nUSBL position is solely based on the USBL underwater tracking of the vehicle. The Realtime Nav Data is SuBastian’s INS, which takes into account several inputs to make an educated calculation on position. In general, Realtime Nav Data is the position you should be using, but always ask the MT’s on your cruise.\nCan I delete an event?\nOnly system administrators have the ability to delete an event, but you can ask an MT to delete it for you if needed.\nCan I edit a past event?\nYou cannot edit a past event, but you can add a “comment” to the event where you can correct or add more information.\nWhen I search for a known event, nothing is shown.\nGreat Question! We are still working on this one :)\nCan I review the dive after it is over?\nYes, while on the ship you can review the dive. All of the data during the dive is being transferred to the PI-NAS, which you’ll have access to throughout the cruise. Shortly after the end of a dive, the dive summary and screengrabs will be available on the PI-Nas.\nCan I replay a dive?\nUnder Review Cruises/Dives, after you’ve navigated to the correct year, cruiseID and dive number, you can select “Replay” which will allow you to step through every event logged during that dive.\nAm I able to login to Salog after I am off the ship?\nCurrently this is not available, however all data associated with Sealog is found in your Cruise Data Folder under each dive.\nWhat if I forgot to screen grab an event?\nSealog has a feature called “ASNAP” that takes a screengrab on a designated timed interval. The default is set to 1 per minute, but depending on your needs, you can make this more or less frequent. Speak to the Marine Technicians about changing your ASNAP interval.\nCan we change templates after initial configuration?\nYes of course, you can change templates to better fit your needs anytime, but it’s recommended that you spend time prior to the first dive to get the dive templates to fit your needs. Certain templates (like sampling) need to be approved by Marine Technicians."
